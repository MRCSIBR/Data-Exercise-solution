# Data Science Exercise Solutions with Streamlit Deployment

This repository contains solutions for two data science exercises, along with a Streamlit deployment for interactive visualization and exploration of the results. 


Exercise 1: Data Exercise 1: ETL Geopositional

    Objective: Create a script to extract all the geo_points and return them in a format suitable for building an Echart map centered on the area of greatest relevance. 
               The final result should be able to load a CSV file with data and generate a centered map.
    
    Solution: First data cleaning and transformation is performed on the dataset for correct visualization.
    
    Data: For testing use geo-data.csv.
    Visualization (Streamlit): Load the csv with geolocation data and a map with datapoints will show.

Exercise 2: Data Exercise 2: News classifier

    Objective: Create a news classifier based on data in news_training_data.csv.
               The final result should be able to load a CSV with data and generate a table with the classification.
    Solution: News Classifier using Naive-Bayes.
    Data: For testing use dataset `news-training-data.csv`.
    Visualization (Streamlit): Load news dataset and press `Classify news` button.
