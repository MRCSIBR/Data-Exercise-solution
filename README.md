# Data Science Exercise Solutions with Streamlit Deployment

This repository contains solutions for two data science exercises, along with a Streamlit deployment for interactive visualization and exploration of the results. 
The exercises cover various aspects of data analysis, and the solutions are implemented using Python.

Exercise 1: Data Exercise 1: ETL Geopositional

    Objective: Briefly describe the goal or objective of the first exercise.
    Solution: Provide a summary of the approach taken and key findings.
    Code: Link to the relevant Jupyter Notebook or Python script for the solution.
    Data: For testing use geo-data.csv.
    Visualization (Streamlit): Load the csv with geolocation data and a map with datapoints will show.

Exercise 2: Data Exercise 2: News classifier

    Objective: Briefly describe the goal or objective of the second exercise.
    Solution: News Classifier using Naive-Bayes.
    Data: For testing use dataset: news-training-data.csv.
    Visualization (Streamlit): Include instructions on how to run the Streamlit app to explore the results interactively.
